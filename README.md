# AMIT_GraduationProject

Glove for deaf people, is an idea created to help deaf society to merge in life without feeling difficulty in communication with others, 
the core of the project depends on translating sign language to written words in real time when the deaf person communicates with his hands, where the device will 
take data of every movement of hand from sensors that are built-in the glove and calculate flexion of each finger which will be processed by microcontroller 
embedded system in the glove and produce an output in the form of words on LCD.
